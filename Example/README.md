# Hello All

This repository is a collection of all the assignments I did while attending CodingDojo's bootcamp. I have two folders that showcase my Python assignments and another folder there will showcase my Web Fundamentals assignments. 

As I continue to learn and grow as a developer, I will start to utilize github repos to showcase my projects. 
Happy coding!
